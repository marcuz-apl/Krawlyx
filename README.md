# zenCrawl

A self-hosted web scraping workbench: paste URLs, pick a crawl engine from an
admin-curated pool, run batch crawls on demand or on a cron schedule, and land
results in SQLite or as auto-splitting CSV/XLSX files in a shared folder.

Free and open source (MIT) — every dependency is open source and runs locally;
no paid APIs.

## Status

📋 Planning phase — see [`PRD.md`](PRD.md) for requirements and
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the engineering contract used by AI agents and humans.

## Planned stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | Python · FastAPI · SQLAlchemy · APScheduler |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| Engines | Crawl4AI, Scrapy (pluggable adapter registry) |
| Storage | SQLite (WAL) + CSV/XLSX export with size-based splitting |

## Versioning

This repo uses the **alfazen-versioning** contract: the root `VERSION` file holds
`v{m.n.p}-{yymmddc}` (release version + UTC date/daily-counter build id). Git
hooks in `.githooks/` bump and stamp every commit automatically — enable them
after cloning with:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```
